# `NoteToolbar` Component Documentation

## Overview

The `NoteToolbar` is a React component that provides a user interface for interacting with note-related functionalities. It displays icons for calendar, location, and music, each of which can presumably trigger different actions related to a note.

### Imports

- `React`: React library for building user interfaces.
- `Calendar`, `MapPin`, `Music`: Icon components from `lucide-react` used to represent different functionalities.

## Component: `NoteToolbar`

This stateless functional component renders a toolbar with icons for calendar, location, and music functionalities. Each icon is interactive, with hover effects to enhance user experience.

### Structure

The component consists of a `div` element styled with a white background, padding, rounded corners, and a shadow for consistency. Inside, there is another `div` that uses Flexbox to layout three spans evenly across the toolbar. Each span contains an icon representing a different feature:

1. **Calendar Icon**: Represents date-related functions.
2. **Map Pin Icon**: Represents location-related functions.
3. **Music Icon**: Represents music or audio-related functions.

Each icon is styled to be a cursor pointer, changing color on hover to indicate interactivity.

### Styling

- The toolbar has a class of `bg-white p-2 rounded shadow`.
- Icons are initially styled with `text-gray-600` and transition to `text-gray-800` on hover, indicating they are interactive elements.

### Accessibility

Each span containing an icon has a `title` attribute which provides a tooltip on hover, enhancing the accessibility and user experience by describing the function of the icon.
