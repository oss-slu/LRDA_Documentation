# `VideoComponent` Documentation

## Overview

`VideoComponent` is a comprehensive React component designed for uploading, processing, and viewing videos. It integrates functionalities such as uploading videos, generating thumbnails, and displaying video lists using custom UI components.

## Imports

- **React**: Utilizes `React.FC`, `useState`, `useEffect`.
- **Components**:
  - `VideoIcon`, `UploadIcon` from `lucide-react` for visual elements.
  - `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger` from `@radix-ui/react-popover` for managing the upload interface.
  - `Dialog`, `DialogContent`, `DialogDescription`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogTrigger` from `@/components/ui/dialog` for modal dialogues.
  - `Input` from `@/components/ui/input` for file input.
  - `MediaViewer` from `../media_viewer` for displaying video previews.
- **Utils**:
  - `uploadMedia` from `../../utils/s3_proxy` for uploading files to an S3 bucket.
  - `getVideoThumbnail`, `getVideoDuration` from `../../utils/api_service` for processing video files.
  - `uuidv4` for generating unique identifiers.
  - `toast` from `sonner` for user notifications.

## Properties

- `videoArray`: Array of `VideoType` objects representing the videos.
- `setVideo`: React dispatch function to update the video array state.

## Functionality

- **Video Upload**: Handles file selection and initiates an upload process including video file and thumbnail generation. Updates the video list upon successful uploads.
- **Video Processing**: Retrieves video duration and generates thumbnails using external utility functions.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user feedback through toast notifications for various stages of the upload and processing steps.

## User Interaction

- **Viewing Videos**: Utilizes a `Dialog` component to display the current list of videos or a message if no videos are present.

### Interconnectivity

- **Linked with**:
  - `NoteEditor`: Provides video content that is part of the note being edited.

- **Data Flow**:
  - Sends video details (URL, thumbnail, duration) back to `NoteEditor` after successful upload and processing, integrating it into the current note's content.

- **Event Handling**:
  - Updates in `VideoComponent` trigger updates in `NoteEditor`, ensuring that all multimedia content is up-to-date in the note preview and save functionality.
