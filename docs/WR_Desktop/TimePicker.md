# `TimePicker` 

## Overview

`TimePicker` is a React component that facilitates the selection of both dates and specific times through an intuitive user interface that combines a calendar display and a time input field. The component aims to provide an easy way for users to set precise times for events, reminders, or other date-related functionalities.

## Imports

- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect` from React for managing component state and effects.
- **Components**:
  - `CalendarIcon` from `lucide-react` for the calendar button.
  - `Button`, `Calendar` from `@/components/ui` for selecting dates.
  - `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger` from `@radix-ui/react-popover` for managing the calendar overlay.
  - `Input` from `@/components/ui` for time input.

## Properties

- `initialDate`: The date that the component initially displays and manipulates.
- `onTimeChange`: A callback function that gets called whenever the selected date or time changes.

## Functionality

The component initializes with a date provided via `initialDate` and sets up an effect to update its state whenever `initialDate` changes. Users can interact with the component to select both a date from the calendar and a specific time using the time input field, which together allow for precise control over date and time selection.

## User Interaction

- **Selecting a Date**: Users can open a popover containing a calendar by clicking on the calendar icon button. Selecting a date in the calendar updates the internal state and the displayed date next to the calendar icon.
- **Setting the Time**: Adjacent to the calendar display, a time input allows the user to specify the exact time for the selected date. This input uses a standard "HH:MM" format.
