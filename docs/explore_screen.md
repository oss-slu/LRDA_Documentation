# Introduction

The Explore Screen of Where's Religion is centered around the Map feature that comes from the Google Maps API. This map has pins and cards which represents notes that people have created from around the world. Users view the map in three different ways. One is by zooming in and out of the map and exploring the pin they want to view. Another view is by searching for the note using the searchbar on the top. Finally, users can also scroll through the card selection at the bottom of the screen to view notes.
